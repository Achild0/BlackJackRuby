# BlackJack Ruby

Juste a "great" BlackJack game made in ruby ! Way for me to learn a bit the language.

For now just console stuff so no gui, but playable.

## TODO List :

* Secure the code a bit - **Mainly user indput**
* Multiplayer
* Dealer IA
* A bit of story/rpg for solo (Like a loan that you have to cash back and stuff linked to that)
* Leaderboard
